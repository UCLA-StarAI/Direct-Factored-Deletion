Direct & Factored Deletion
==========================

Prototype implementation of direct and factored deletion algorithms to learn Bayesian network parameters from incomplete data under the MCAR and MAR assumptions. These algorithms are consistent, yet they only require a single pass over the data, and no inference in the Bayesian network.
